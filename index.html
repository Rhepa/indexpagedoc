			<h2>Inspiration/Process</h2>
			<p>
				I wanted to be creative for this project. However, I was having an art block, making no progress and then thinking of doing a plain website with links that links to my work. Luckily, I was able to think of something, then proceeded to pursue it despite being time consuming. I already made a UI style guide for it, so I based it off that but I cended up changing some of the fonts to suit my theme more.

				When I thought of index list, I somehow thought of a shopping list. So then I had an idea where I'd draw small shops on road, that the user can click on it to "enter" the website. There's also some interactivity with the city landscape. Thinking this was due on Tuesday and not monday, I ended up having limited interactivity and animation. (T^T) I had ideas of small people walking down the road, change the day to night by clicking on the lamp post, adding more cars, and more to bring the website to life.

				I was aiming to create something calm, and relaxing that allows the user to "explore" the small town whihc is also why I added the rain effect, and rain soundtrack (rain makes me happy). For the iframes, I made an iframe that acts as an "ad".

						An issue I faced was adding Responsive design. I felt like this was more suited for desktop, so I decided to focus on it. (hoping I won't get penalized too much) I tried my best making it responsive, however I personally think that it's not suitable. 

						Another issue I faced was the audio. I couldn't style the audio, into how I wanted so I just lowered the opacity, and reduced the size so only the play button is there. I wanted to style the audio into moving clouds.
